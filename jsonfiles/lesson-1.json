By the end of this session, you will understand what DSA actually means, where it shows up in real life and why interviewers love it.\n\nTake notes and feel free to pause and try the code! Let’s begin.",
  "blogArticle": "## Lesson 1: Introduction to DSA\n\nData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of efficient programming.\n\n### Why DSA?\n- Makes your solutions faster\n- Improves memory usage\n- Helps crack interviews & competitive programming\n\n### Core Concepts\n- **Data Structure**: A way to organize data\n- **Algorithm**: A procedure to solve a problem optimally\n\n### Real-Life Example\nPhone contact list = data structure\nBinary search on sorted names = algorithm\n\nWelcome to the world of smart programming! 🚀",
