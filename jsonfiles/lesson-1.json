By the end of this session, you will understand what DSA actually means, where it shows up in real life and why interviewers love it.\n\nTake notes and feel free to pause and try the code! Let’s begin.",

  "blogArticle": "## Lesson 1: Introduction to DSA\n\nData Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is the cornerstone of efficient programming.\n\n### Why is DSA important?\n- Improves problem solving\n- Helps you write code that runs faster\n- Critical in exams and technical interviews\n- Better memory and performance management\n\n### Definition\n- **Data structure**: A way to store and organize data\n- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem\n\n### Real-life example\nYour **phone contact list** is a data structure.\nSearching for a contact using **A→Z sorting** is an algorithm.\n\n### What you will learn in this course\n- Powerful structures: arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs\n- Algorithms like sorting, searching, DP & more\n\n✨ Practice daily = DSA mastery. Ready? 🚀",
