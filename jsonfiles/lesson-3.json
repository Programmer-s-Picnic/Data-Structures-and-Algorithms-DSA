  "videoScript": "Welcome back to Programmer’s Picnic! Today’s lesson is all about Arrays — one of the most fundamental building blocks in Data Structures.\n\nBy the end of this video, you'll understand what arrays are, why they exist, how indexing works, and how to store and access data efficiently.\n\nLet’s begin!\n\n1. What is an Array?\nAn array is a collection of elements stored in a **contiguous block of memory**.\n\n2. Why Arrays?\nFast access using indexing — O(1) time.\n\n3. Real-life Analogy:\nThink of an array like a row of identical boxes placed side-by-side. Each box has an address (index), and you can quickly jump to any box.\n\n4. Python Reminder:\nIn Python, arrays are implemented as **lists**, which are more flexible than low-level arrays.\n\nLet’s explore arrays in action!",

  "blogArticle": "## Lesson 3: Arrays\n\nArrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures.\nThey allow us to store multiple values under a single name and access them using their position (index).\n\n---\n### 🔹 What is an Array?\nAn **array** is a collection of items stored at **contiguous memory locations**.\n- Fast access → O(1)\n- Fixed-size in low-level languages\n- Python lists behave like dynamic arrays\n\n---\n### 🔹 How Indexing Works\nIndexes start at **0**.\n\nExample:\n```\narr = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nprint(arr[2])  # Output: 30\n```\n\n---\n### 🔹 Array Traversal\nVisit every element one-by-one:\n```\nfor x in arr:\n    print(x)\n```\nTime complexity: **O(n)**\n\n---\n### 🔹 Applications of Arrays\n- Storing sequences (marks, prices, temperatures)\n- Implementing higher-level DS (stacks, queues, heaps)\n- Efficient mathematical & statistical computing\n\nArrays are the gateway to linear data structures. Master them well! 🚀",
